                university life I was trying to be a self- dependent guy. But I didn't find any way to establish my
                dream. It was 2020, The whole world was stucked by a pandameic named covid-19. For this I went back to
                home. at that time I found my school friend named Arif who is an SEO specialist. One day he called me
                and told me everything about his work. and after listening him I was determined to know about SEO in
                details. My friend Arif and Islam helped me to know about SEO and they help me each and every day. Now
                I'm learning web development from programming hero and I thing it is going very good so far. I wish I
                will be a good developer in future. keep me in your prayer. </p>
